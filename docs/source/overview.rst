Overview
========

**VisualQC** is an application package allowing data dan metadata quality control for instrument and technical managers, and seismologists. It's based on `obspy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/ wiki>`_.

There are 2 main processes in this data and metadata quality control, generation of plots and validation.

Generation of plots
-------------------

The package contains the scripts to generate plots for a map of stations, data availability, instrument response by station or by channel, time waveforms by station or by channel and probabilistic power spectral densities (PPSD) by station, or only by channel.

Validation
----------

The generated images representing data and metadata of a campaign will be validated by referenced scientists and / or technical experts via web via a web server. The auditors can then surf easily from one image to another during a validation process.
